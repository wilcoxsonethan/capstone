    Project Description
</h2>
<p>
    Our project is creating a paper stock trading application. Paper trading is trading stocks and options exactly like you would with a brokerage account except you donâ€™t use real money so you can try out different trading strategies. Our main objectives for our application are to create an iOS app that a user can buy and sell stocks and options while learning different strategies. We will create a financial advisor like assistant to recommend new trading strategies for varying levels of users. In addition, we will create a notification system to send users a notification for market news and events relating to positions they hold within their account. The main goal of our application is to create a learning tool for varying levels of experience in stock trading to gain new financial knowledge. We will be implementing this using React Native (for frontend), Django (for Backend), Postman (for an API platform), Docker (for dependency handling), Figma (for UI/UX), PostgreSQL (for DBMS), and Railway (for hosting).
