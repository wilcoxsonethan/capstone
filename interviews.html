<h2>Summary of interviews</h2>
<p>
  These interviews were extremely informative on very important aspects of our project. Our questions covered a wide range of important topics and much of the information we learned will be used and implemented in the design phase of our project. We learned that a user’s experience level in the stock market has a direct correlation to the type of user interface they prefer. Users who have less experience tend to favor sleek and clean user interface design as they have no real use for the extra bells and whistles that the more experienced users favor. With this we may limit the use of stock options for traders with little to no experience and provide advanced stock options data for the advanced user. For beginners it is more important to give them the basics and not overwhelm them with data they may not understand. Furthermore, users with different trading philosophies will want and need very different types of information about a particular stock. Users who prefer the Fundamental philosophy want to look at detailed information about a particular company as well as past performance, competitors, and news. These types of traders tend to hold stocks for longer thus historical data is more important. The others will favor technical trading which relies more heavily on data like volume trading, price variability, and certain key signals in the market. These types of traders trade in the short term and may not need things like historical data or even detailed information about the company they are buying into. Detailed graphs would be more important to this type of user. Another important quality to consider for our users is their personal level of risk tolerance. Establishing a user’s risk tolerance is an important first step to take before delving into the many different strategies they can employ in the stock market. A.I was another interesting talking point in these interviews. A.I seems to be best used in evaluating companies using a mix of fundamentals and technical in order to alert traders to potential trades that would take much longer for human traders to decipher. The ability to instantly collect loads of data on a particular stock and evaluate options depending on a user’s strategy is the best way to implement A.I in a helpful way to traders. These interviews will help us to create not only a much better user interface, but a better user experience for traders overall

<h2>Interview with Ryan from Symmetry Capital</h2>
<p>
  Mason(interviewer)<br>
  Hey, How's it going?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Good, good, good.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Do I have your permission to record this call real quick before I get started?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yes, you have my permission.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  All right, perfect. So we're just going to go ahead and jump right into it. So what prior knowledge do you have on stock trading, if any?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Uh, not much. I started getting into it around my senior year of college, so not too much.
  I'm a little late to the game.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  And what was your major in college finance?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Is it common for finance majors to be interested in the stock market?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah. A lot of my fellow peers did study it. Some were a little bit more into it than I was, but I know the surface level of it.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Sure, sure. Okay. So if you were given an opportunity to start trying different stock trading strategies in advance without having to put down your own money, would you be interested in doing that, Just generally speaking?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah. That kind of knowledge of how the market and industry works is something I find very interesting. So if there was a kind of a risk free good training program, I'd absolutely use it.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Nice. So with that being said, so for someone who maybe isn't as experienced, Do you think they would like help with coming up with some of these different strategies or maybe a bot that would point you in the right direction getting started, do you think?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Absolutely. Absolutely. Because I mean, I'm just a beginner that only knows the very, very low level basics.
  And I mean, I feel like trying to figure out a new technique that would be successful would be like trying to reinvent the wheel. So definitely having some guidance would be huge for someone around my level.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Yeah, I have to agree with you there. So personally, what kind of risk tolerance do you have with just financial investment in general?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  I mean, my dad always kind of gave me advice. It's better to do a lot of low level risks with lesser money for each stock because it accumulates over time rather than just going for the big catch on one and potentially losing a lot more. Diluting your stocks would be a better option.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Okay. So yeah, you would say low risk then?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah.<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Do you have anything particularly in mind?<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Well, I mean, you kind of just said this, but, like, what strategies would you like to try? Maybe can't because of the financial risk. Like saying you would go all in on one, right? Would that be something maybe you'd want to try?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah. Yeah. I kind of just, again, like, diluting like a bunch of my stocks and just a bunch of low level safe bets is more so the approach.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Do you think you would try any options or perhaps shorting stocks if you were doing it without financial risk?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There's a big payoff in those. Yeah, Big payout, Big risk.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  So do you currently have a brokerage account with anybody?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  I do. I have one with Fidelity.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  So why did you choose that broker in particular?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  They are such a well-respected company. Some of my family members who worked there swear by it. A lot of my friends who were there, they advised me to go there.
  So it just seemed like the right route for me.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Sure, that makes sense to me.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Feel free to answer this however you feel. But would you trust A.I intelligence to help create investment strategies for you?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  You know, I would want to kind of see how this goes, but I definitely and I'm pretty confident it's going to go like a track record.<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  It's getting pretty insane with its technology. It's just learning new stuff every day, it seems like. So if they find a good algorithm for it and a good confidence system with it. Yeah, I would absolutely try it out.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Sure. Okay. So with that, would you like to be notified like, let's say with your Fidelity app would you like up to date news notifications about not just similar stocks but also similar strategies that you're using?<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Would you like push notifications for any of that?<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Absolutely. Sure.<br>
  Mason<br>
  All right. Do you prefer to have lots of information shown to you or more of a clean, user friendly interface that has less information? Like maybe I don't know if you've ever seen Robinhood, but that would be like a clean interface compared to something like Fidelity that uses a more data intensive interface, less user friendly, more data.<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Um, I would say more data because if this was something I was really getting and as I am getting more serious into it, having more access to more data and knowledge about the market will only get you so much further than just having a surface level amount.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Sure, right. Right. And I think that's going to end the interview. And I appreciate you doing this interview with me.<br><br>
  Ryan<br>
  Thanks for having me. And of course.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Interview with Tim from Charles Schwab</h2>
<p>
  Mason<br>
  So the first question here is, what prior knowledge do you have on stock trading just in general?<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  Yes. So I work in financial services. I've been a licensed stockbroker since 1998 and I'm a series 24 registered principal. So a lot of experience.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Yeah. So would you with that said, based on your experience, should they have maybe some kind of stock trading bot or an AI algorithm to help them kind of dip their toes in the water of, you know, stock trading?<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So my thought on AI is really there's a couple of things. One, I think I could be extremely helpful in reducing risk. So one of the challenges for novice investors is making an investment decision that they may not have as much information, \
  you know, may not have all of the information or all of the necessary decision making information before they actually place a trade.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So It can be really helpful in helping them understand based on their risk profile and their risk tolerance and their financial goals. In other words, what do they want to do?
  AI could be a really helpful determinant in protecting somebody from making a decision and an informed decision or a misguided decision.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Sure.<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  Assuming that they are going to trade in more, say, securities, not just stocks, but mutual funds, ETFs and stocks.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  The other thing A.I can do is, again, understanding all of the variables, as you know, in someone's investment profile can help them with investment selection. So given that there's, you know, 20,000 plus publicly traded companies and even more mutual funds and ETFs, what are the given the amount of risk they're willing to accept,
  what their financial goals are and what they're trying to accomplish and what their time horizon is, What would be a security that would best meet those needs.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So like, those are the two things kind of off the top that I think I could easily equip. A novice investor is understanding where the risk is. And then secondly, helping them pick the right investments.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  Perfect. That's perfect. So first, now, personally, what kind of risk tolerance would you say you have?<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  I would say moderate to aggressive.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So the older I get, the less aggressive I am. And that's kind of consistent with most people, right? When you're young, you can afford to lose it all and rebuild it and lose it all and rebuild it. The older you get, the less time you have to invest.
  So I would say I'm still a fairly aggressive investor, but I'm not looking to take the risk at this point in my life.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So I would say I'm a moderately aggressive investor.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  I got to agree with you there. I'm on the high end as far as risk, just generally speaking. And I have the most time to recover and rebuild my TD Ameritrade account whenever I want.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  So let's see, are there any financial strategies you haven't tried because of the financial risk and that's kind of to say, you know, with paper trading, you don't have to risk your own funds.<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  Is there anything you would like to try and maybe you haven't?<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  Yeah, I mean, again, this is all speculation, but I would say the things that if I were to, you know, I'd say, how do I say this? Two things that people with a lot of money and a high tolerance for risk can do that I don't necessarily get involved with.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  And I haven't tried what we call long short strategies. So one of the things you can do is use derivatives or options, stock options to amplify the amount of return that you can get instead of investing in the stock, you're just investing in that in the ability for the stock to grow or decline.
  And so in a long, short strategy, you're neither long a meaning you own or you buy into stock options.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So you know, calls or you are short, which means you're taking a negative position against the market or against an individual's security. And what happens in that type of a strategy is you can you can gain more than you would if you were investing all of those securities individually
  because you're only investing in the marginal, if you will.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  But what's the right word, the derivative growth rate. With investing in all of those, the risk is extremely high because sometimes, for example, you can buy a stock option. If that option has a strike price, let's say $50 and the stock never exceeds $50. So you never even get the ability to use it and then it expires.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So I've invested a small amount of money. I lose all of it once the option expires. So that's the risk I'm not willing to take at this point, although I have friends who've done similar strategies, if I were playing with securities, like you said, a paper security, that would be one that would be fun to explore.<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  Okay, perfect.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  I'll tell you a good example of where AI could actually help.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  You know, you place that trade and immediately put in front of you what's their historical performance? What's the variability of the stock? What's the trade volume? It can search to see if there's any probable or you know, if there's any M&A activity out there involving that. So that's a great example of why I think managing risk with A.I is actually helpful.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  That's where A.I can be helpful. . I'm saying that's a really good example of where it can help tap the brakes before you take a shot. Yeah, I've wondered that myself as if there would be a way to kind of see those things coming. Yeah. That I would be able to piece that puzzle together a lot quicker than regular people can.<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  So kind of an easy question. Do you have a broker app on your phone currently?<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  I have to keep our investments and I have somebody we keep our investments at Charles Schwab because I, until very recently, was working for Schwab. And while they don't have you know, they have the ability to trade, trade online, I actually have somebody do it for us.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  So I have an advisor who's doing it. So I have the ability, but I don't use it.<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  So what kind of stock market strategies do you think most people generally fall into?<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  Yeah, And so there's two basic kinds in stock trading. So there's 2 to 2 kinds of accepted Philosophy's One is what we call fundamental, you know, so if you're a fundamental stock picker, you're someone who goes back and looks at historical performance.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  You track everybody within, say, a particular a particular segment of the market, and you say, okay, well, what have they done historically? What's their management look like? They call it fundamental because it's kind of like in sports, it's getting back to the blocking and tackling, like how have they performed in the past? Who are their competitors? What do they do?<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  That is called fundamental and it's more behavioral, right? You're looking at things that you can see and read, but you're looking at the past to kind of predict the future. And it's not science. It's literally how you feel about the information that you're looking at.<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  The second is technical analysis that looks at statistical happenings within the stock market or within an individual security that people that ascribe to that philosophy think predict what's going to happen.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  And so it's literally looking at volume trading, price variability, a lot of statistical measures of what's going on in the market and uses those to then predict what's going to happen in the future. And a couple examples, like they call it head and shoulders. When you get to a head and shoulders on an individual security, a sector or a particular area of the market, it means that and again, I'm not a stock trader, but when they see that it signifies or it has historically signified that some event either an increase in price or a decrease in price is going to happen shortly thereafter within a period of time.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  And so technical traders will use this information to predict whether they think the stock is going to go up or go down. And so they'll take a lot of short term positions in the market. And that's technical trading. They're not necessarily even looking at what the security who their competitors are or any of that fundamental data. They're just looking at technical analysis, ups and downs, volume, etc..<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  And they're using that information to put together a stock strategy. And if you get everything in between, but those are the two primary schools of thought are two dominant schools of thought.<br><br>
  Mason<br>
  This question involves brokerage apps. In your opinion Do you think it would be more important to have a clean user interface or to have a less user friendly interface with way more data just to go off of?<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  What do you think would be better for individuals?<br><br>
  Tim<br>
  So I think they're yeah, it's a good question. So I think there's an inverse relationship with experience and experience and comfort trading, right? If you have very little experience and you are not comfortable placing trades or evaluating stocks or making investments like that, then the user interface I think is important.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  And you don't necessarily need a tremendous amount of functionality, at least in the beginning. If I am a more experienced, more confident trader, then all I care about is the features and functionality right here. And this is kind of the difference between the iPhone in the in the Android the Android's not as you know it's not as clean and neat and everything but it has more functionality generally you can do more things on or used to be able to whereas iPhones they just work right they connect to all their Apple devices They you don't have to think about it much.<br><br>

  Tim<br>
  You don't have to be a computer expert to use them. They just work. And so I would say the same inverse relationship exists when it comes to. So for me, I care more about the user interface when it comes to trading because, as I said, I'm moderately aggressive, but I'm not one to go out and chase individual stocks.<br><br>

  Mason<br>
  All right. I think we've pretty much hit all our marks here. Okay.
  Thank you so much for the interview.<br><br>

<h2>Interview with Richard Weir</h2>
<p>
  What prior knowledge do you have on stock trading?<br>
  I’ve been purchasing stocks since I got my first stimulus check in 2020. I consider myself a beginner trader and I have a lot to learn.<br><br>
  Would you like an opportunity to try out your stock trading strategies in advance?<br>
  Yes, I think that would be beneficial to a trader like myself.<br><br>
  Would you like help in creating your stock trading strategies?<br>
  Yes. Some guidance on both long- and short-term strategies would be beneficial to a trader like myself.<br><br>
  What kind of risk tolerance do you have? (Do you prefer safer and small returns of risky and large returns)<br>
  I prefer safer and smaller returns that will allow me to retire by 60. I like to invest money and not police its earnings. Being hands off is what I like. If it’s out of sight, it’s out of mind.<br><br>
  What strategies would you like to try but haven’t because of financial risk or lack of knowledge?(shorting, options, etc.)<br>
  Even though I consider myself a long-term investor, I would like to learn how to trade options. I know that options trading is super risky, but with high risk comes high rewards.<br><br>
  Do you currently have a brokerage account with any broker?<br>
  Yes, JP Morgan Chase Brokerage on the Chase Mobile Banking app<br><br>
  Why did you choose that broker?<br>
  I’ve banked with Chase since I was 18, and it’s easy to transfer money in and out from my checking account to my brokerage account.<br><br>
  Would you trust AI to help create good investment strategies for you?<br>
  I would trust AI to assist in my research process. I am skeptical of AI and I am unfamiliar with everything it’s capable of.<br><br>
  Would you like up to date news notifications about similar stocks and strategies that you employ?<br>
  If I was going to try day trading or some other short term strategy , that would be beneficial to me. But since I’m more of an index fund investor, it doesn’t strike my interest.<br><br>
  Do you prefer to have lots of information shown to you on your brokerage account or a clean user interface with less information.<br>
  I would prefer more information. Sometimes if something is too simplified, it can be aggravating. A good interface is appealing and if it gives me the option to dive deeper into the details that would be ideal.<br><br>
  What aspects of a stock make it attractive for sound investment strategies?<br>
  The future of that stock. If I believe the company is going to be around for the next 50-100 years, I would be inclined to buy and hold. If the company’s products and reputation is far ahead of its competition, that intrigues me.<br><br>
  Do you prefer growth stocks or value stocks?<br>
  Growth stocks. I like to buy and hold.<br><br>

</p>
